            I'm so excited to be working with my first framework. It was cool building our own servers, and it really helps me appreciate how much easier this is. It's remarkable how much easier it is to build a web app now than it was only a few weeks ago. Something that would have taken a week to do as a team, and I can now do in a day. Even something like wireframing the site was so simple that I had time to learn Bootstrap while I was at it.
